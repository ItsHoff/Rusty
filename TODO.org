* Fix
** Shadow acne in sponza
* Features
** Primary
*** Dynamic lights
*** Glossy materials
*** Mirror reflections
*** Transparent materials
*** Bidirectional tracing
** Nice to have
*** Participating media
*** Additional camera models
    * thin lenses
    * thick lenses
    * lens systems
*** Possibility to switch between floats and doubles
*** Alternate input formats
    * glTF
    * pbrt
*** Other shapes
    * Would need new format support
*** Procedural textures
** Extras
*** DIY linear algebra
*** Spectral rendering
* Improvements
** Utils
*** Selected camera locations for scenes
*** Config for render parameters
*** Arbitrary scene loading
*** UI
** Performance
*** Parallel building of BVH
*** Pure hit tests without extra info
   * Can stop when any hit is found instead of finding the closests
*** Spatial curves for 2d vector ordering
   * e.g. textures
   * Hilbert / Morton
*** Examine cache effiency
   * size
   * organization (hot & cold)
   * alignment
** Quality
*** Implement post processing for offline images
    * Preferably use the same shaders rather than doing this on the cpu
    * Headless context + texture as a framebuffer
*** Termination probability based on current ray throughput
*** Proper sRGB gamma curve
   * PBRT 621
*** Better filtering and reconstruction
*** More robust floating point error handling
** Refactoring
*** Scene loading
    * reduce redundancy
    * builder pattern
    * examine self references
    * leave room for different input formats
    * float type agnostic (for pt)
*** Statistics api
    * Stat prints for online rendering
*** Let materials handle bxdfs
*** Constant textures in materials?
*** Refer to tris from light rather than copy tri

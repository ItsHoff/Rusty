* Fix
** Shadow acne in sponza
  * floating point error
  * not present with f64
* Features
** Primary
*** Bidirectional tracing
** Nice to have
*** Dynamic lights
*** Participating media
*** Additional camera models
    * thin lenses
    * thick lenses
    * lens systems
*** Alternate input formats
    * glTF
    * pbrt
*** Other shapes
    * Would need new format support
*** Procedural textures
** Extras
*** DIY linear algebra
*** Spectral rendering
* Improvements
** Utils
*** Runtime config for render parameters
*** Arbitrary scene loading
*** UI
** Performance
*** Parallel building of BVH
*** Pure hit tests without extra info
   * Can stop when any hit is found instead of finding the closests
*** Spatial curves for 2d vector ordering
   * e.g. textures
   * Hilbert / Morton
*** Examine cache effiency
   * size
   * organization (hot & cold)
   * alignment
** Quality
*** Proper sRGB gamma curve
   * PBRT 621
*** Better filtering and reconstruction
*** More robust floating point error handling
** Refactoring
*** Statistics api
    * Stat prints for online rendering

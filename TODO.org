* Fix
** Shadow acne in sponza
  * floating point error
  * not present with f64
* Features
** Primary
*** Dynamic lights
*** Glossy materials
    illum 2: Highlight on
    * maybe use diffuse if specular exponent (Ns) is small
*** Mirror reflections
    illum 5: Fresnel reflection
*** Transparent materials
    illum 4: Glass reflection and refraction
    illum 7: Fresnel reflection + refraction
*** Bidirectional tracing
** Nice to have
*** Participating media
*** Additional camera models
    * thin lenses
    * thick lenses
    * lens systems
*** Alternate input formats
    * glTF
    * pbrt
*** Other shapes
    * Would need new format support
*** Procedural textures
** Extras
*** DIY linear algebra
*** Spectral rendering
* Improvements
** Utils
*** Config for render parameters
*** Arbitrary scene loading
*** UI
** Performance
*** Parallel building of BVH
*** Pure hit tests without extra info
   * Can stop when any hit is found instead of finding the closests
*** Spatial curves for 2d vector ordering
   * e.g. textures
   * Hilbert / Morton
*** Examine cache effiency
   * size
   * organization (hot & cold)
   * alignment
** Quality
*** Implement post processing for offline images
    * Preferably use the same shaders rather than doing this on the cpu
    * Headless context + texture as a framebuffer
*** Termination probability based on current ray throughput
*** Proper sRGB gamma curve
   * PBRT 621
*** Better filtering and reconstruction
*** More robust floating point error handling
** Refactoring
*** Statistics api
    * Stat prints for online rendering
*** Let materials handle bxdfs
*** Constant textures in materials?
*** Refer to tris from light rather than copy tri

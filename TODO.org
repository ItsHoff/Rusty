* Fix
** Shadow acne in sponza
- floating point error
- not present with f64

* Features
** Nice to have
*** Dynamic lights
*** Participating media
*** Additional camera models
- thin lenses
- thick lenses
- lens systems

*** Alternate input formats
- glTF
- pbrt

*** Other shapes
- Would need new format support

*** Procedural textures
** Extras
*** DIY linear algebra
*** Spectral rendering
* Improvements
** Utils
*** UI
** Performance
*** Parallel building of BVH
*** Spatial curves for 2d vector ordering
- e.g. textures
- Hilbert / Morton

*** Examine cache effiency
- size
- organization (hot & cold)
- alignment

** Quality
*** Proper sRGB gamma curve
- PBRT page 621

*** Better filtering and reconstruction
*** More robust floating point error handling
- Need to figure out (u, v) error or switch to pbrt intersections

** Refactoring
*** Statistics api
- Stat prints for online rendering

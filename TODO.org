* Fixes
** Shadow acne in sponza
* Features
** Dynamic lights
** Glossy materials
** Mirror reflections
** Transparent materials
** Bidirectional tracing
* Improvements
** Stat prints for online rendering
** Implement post processing for offline images
  * Preferably use the same shaders rather than doing this on the cpu
** Concurrent data structures
  * https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam
** Arbitrary scene loading
** UI
* Optimizations
** Parallel building of BVH
** Change work distribution to use atomic counter and one to one mapping to a block
** Precompute negative components of ray direction
** Pure hit tests without extra info
  * Can stop when any hit is found instead of finding the closests
** Would AABB on invidual triangles save work
** Spatial curves for 2d vector ordering
  * e.g. textures
  * Hilbert / Morton
** Examine cache effiency
  * size
  * organization (hot & cold)
  * alignment
* Nice to have
** Better filtering and reconstruction
** Other shapes
** Alternate cameras
  * thin lenses
  * thick lenses
  * lens systems
** Alternate input formats (glTF)
** Get texture mapping debug texture somewhere
** More robust floating point error handling
** Posibility to switch between floats and doubles
** HDR image formats
  * Does OpenGL support HDR output?
* Extras
** Internal linear algebra
** Spectral rendering
